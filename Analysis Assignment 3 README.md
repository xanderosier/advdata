Story ideas from campus crime data.


A quick look at crime on college campuses from across the country using Pandas in Jupyter notebook reveals a few trends worth 
looking into.

1. The first is the number of burglaries at the University of Toledo and UCLA. With 118, that’s higher than any other school in
the country by more than four times. Why is that? 

2. This dataset would provide good source material for a listicle about the most “crime-ridden” or most violent campuses in the
US. Yes, I know listicles are the worst, but this would be fun to make and would probably generate a lot of traffic. 

3. Why does UC Berkeley report such so many forcible sexual assaults? Thirty is an appallingly high number, especially when 
compared with the rates at other schools. For a school that is known for being socially progressive this is pretty interesting. Definitely worth following up on this and looking at trends over time. 

4. Why are the numbers of “non forcible” sexual assault so low?
