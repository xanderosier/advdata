I'm Alex Derosier. I'm a radio and public radio guy (the distinction is important I think) who found himself in David Herzog's 
CAR class last semester and really enjoyed it! I decided to take this class because I wanted to expand on what I had learned 
and turn into a lean, mean, data processing machine. I hope to use what I learn here to help me with my summer internship 
and in the Washington program this fall.
